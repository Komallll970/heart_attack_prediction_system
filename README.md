<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
The Heart Attack Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether an individual is at risk of a heart attack. By analyzing health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, the system provides predictions along with visualizations of key health factors.<br>
<h3><b>Features of this project are:</b></h3><br>
<b>Data Input:</b> Accepts health parameters including:Age, Sex, Cholesterol levels, Resting blood pressure, Maximum heart rate achieved, Exercise-induced angina,Fasting blood sugar levels,etc.<br>
<b>Prediction:</b> Determines heart attack risk based on input data.<br>
<b>Visualization:</b> Generates charts to help users understand health metrics.<br>
<b>Explainability:</b> Highlights contributing factors for interpretability.<br>
<h3><b>How It Works:</b></h3><br>
1. <b>Input Data: </b>Provide health data manually or via a dataset.<br>
2. <b>Feature Extraction:</b>Extracts clinical features for analysis.<br>
3. <b>Prediction: </b>Uses a trained machine learning model to predict risk.<br>
4. <b>Visualization:</b> Displays visualizations showing key health factors.<br>
5. <b>Results Display:</b> Shows risk status and contributing factors.<br>
<h3><b>Model Details:</b></h3><br>
<b>Algorithm Used:</b> Logistic Regression (or other model).<br>
<b>Training Dataset:</b> Clinical records with features like age and cholesterol.<br>
<b>Accuracy:</b> ~85%<br>
<h3> Conclusion</h3>
The Heart Attack Prediction System serves as a valuable tool for identifying individuals at risk of a heart attack based on various health parameters. By leveraging machine learning models, the system can accurately predict the likelihood of a heart attack, helping users make informed decisions regarding their health. The inclusion of visualizations enhances understanding by highlighting the impact of different health factors, such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, on the risk prediction.<br>With a prediction accuracy of approximately 85%, the system provides reliable insights into cardiovascular risk, potentially aiding in early detection and prevention. This can contribute to better health management, enabling timely interventions and lifestyle changes. However, as with any predictive model, it is important to consider the system as a supplementary tool and seek professional medical advice for comprehensive health assessments.<br>
Overall, the system represents a significant step toward using technology and data analytics in proactive healthcare, empowering individuals with knowledge to manage their heart health effectively.
