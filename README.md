The Heart Attack Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether an individual is at risk of a heart attack. By analyzing health-related features such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, the system provides predictions along with visualizations of key health factors.<br>
<b>Features of this project are:</b>,br>
<b>Data Input:</b> Accepts health parameters including:Age, Sex, Cholesterol levels, Resting blood pressure, Maximum heart rate achieved, Exercise-induced angina,Fasting blood sugar levels,etc.<br>
<b>Prediction:</b> Determines heart attack risk based on input data.<br>
<b>Visualization:</b> Generates charts to help users understand health metrics.<br>
<b>Explainability:<b> Highlights contributing factors for interpretability.<br>
<b>How It Works:</b><br>
1. <b>Input Data: </b>Provide health data manually or via a dataset.<br>
2. <b>Feature Extraction:</b>Extracts clinical features for analysis.<br>
3. <b>Prediction: </b>Uses a trained machine learning model to predict risk.<br>
4. <b>Visualization:</b> Displays visualizations showing key health factors.<br>
5. <b>Results Display:</b> Shows risk status and contributing factors.<br>
<b>Model Details:</b><br>
<b>Algorithm Used:</b> Logistic Regression (or other model).<br>
<b>Training Dataset:</b> Clinical records with features like age and cholesterol.<br>
<b>Accuracy:</b> ~80.43%<br>
